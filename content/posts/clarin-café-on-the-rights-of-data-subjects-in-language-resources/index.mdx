This webinar is part of the TRIPLE Open Science Training Series and was organised as a joint collaboration between CLARIN and the TRIPLE project. 

In this training session Paweł Kamocki, chair of the CLARIN Committee for Legal and Ethical Issues (CLIC), Aleksei Kelli, former chair of the CLIC, and Esther Hoorn, member of the CLIC and legal advisor at the University of Groningen, focus on one of the central elements of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which entered into application on 25 May 2018: the rights of data subjects in language resources.

Francesca Frontini, member of the CLARIN Board of Directors, initiates the webinar with a short introduction of CLARIN ERIC and the TRIPLE project. Paweł Kamocki subsequently provides an overview of the legal framework governing personal data processing in the European Union. The rights of data subjects are divided into restraining and non-restraining rights and are presented by Aleksei Kelli and Paweł Kamocki. Esther Hoorn then shares her perspective on the rights of data subjects in academic practice and showcases examples on the responsibility for handling requests from data subjects in research projects, the exercise of rights in pseudonymised datasets, and transparency regarding the limited nature of rights of data subjects in a research context.
